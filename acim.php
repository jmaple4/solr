            <p>A Course In Miracles is a spiritual path with a unique emphasis on relationships. To discover our own wholeness, we must uncover our oneness with other people, for they are a part of our larger Self, which the Course calls the Christ.</p>

<p>Although Christian in statement, the Course deals with universal spiritual themes. It emphasizes that it is but one version of the universal curriculum. There are many paths, this one differing from them only in form. They all lead to God in the end. A Course In Miracles can help you heal yourself, your relationships, and develop a greater sense of inner peace. It does not ask you to memorize, believe, or approach it with faith. All it requires is that you think about it… try it...experience the results...and decide for yourself.</p>

<p>"When you meet anyone, remember it is a Holy encounter. As you see them you will see yourself. As you treat them, you will treat yourself. As you think of them, you will think of yourself. Never forget this, for in them you will find yourself or lose yourself."</p>
