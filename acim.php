            <p>Summer of Love Student Housing in conjunction with the Community Miracles Center and Music City San Francisco’s Music Academy and Learning Center, presents  A Course in Miracles. (ACIM) A Course in Miracles is a spiritual discipline that consistently focuses on mind training. The idea is that we, as humans, have separated ourselves from our Creator or God and we have designed our own process devoid of God. We call that the ego or the separated thought system. We are taught that we can, at any moment that we choose, tap into the mind of our Creator or God. We do that by asking the Holy Spirit for guidance. There is a strong emphasis on constant vigilance of the ego thought system or, if you will, noticing when we are entering into thoughts that are fear based.</p> 

            <p>The Course is instructed by Reverend Rudy Colombini, Musician, Entertainer, Entrepreneur and Business man.  The Summer of Love Student Housing offers those interested (Obligation Free), an opportunity to drop in on a class and discover their own wholeness and uncover their oneness with people. A Course In Miracles (ACIM), can help you heal yourself, your relationships, and develop a greater sense of inner peace. It does not ask you to memorize, believe, or view the concepts discussed with faith.</p> 

            <p>We recommend you sit in on a class and consider the results in you, for yourself. Although Christian based the Course deals with universal spiritual themes with an emphasis on the importance of LOVE and forgiveness. There are many paths to inner peace, this Course differing from others only in form. They all lead to God. The Course covers a 669 page text book and a 488 page workbook as well as a 92 page instructors’ manual. Check for times and dates.</p>


            <!-- <p>A Course In Miracles is a spiritual path with a unique emphasis on relationships. To discover our own wholeness, we must uncover our oneness with other people, for they are a part of our larger Self, which the Course calls the Christ.</p>

<p>Although Christian in statement, the Course deals with universal spiritual themes. It emphasizes that it is but one version of the universal curriculum. There are many paths, this one differing from them only in form. They all lead to God in the end. A Course In Miracles can help you heal yourself, your relationships, and develop a greater sense of inner peace. It does not ask you to memorize, believe, or approach it with faith. All it requires is that you think about it… try it...experience the results...and decide for yourself.</p> -->

<p>"When you meet anyone, remember it is a Holy encounter. As you see them you will see yourself. As you treat them, you will treat yourself. As you think of them, you will think of yourself. Never forget this, for in them you will find yourself or lose yourself."</p>
