We provide our guest with a 5 Star, Hi Technology driven WiFi Connection supported by some of the best Engineer Artist behind these systems in the Silicon Valley and San Francisco Bay area. We’ve spent nearly $50,000 to bring this service to the building and $20,000 a year making it hi-octane. The System is a SG200-26P Gigabit Backbone Switch with 26 Gigabit Ethernet ports, including 12 Power Over Ethernet ports. (POE) It boasts this high speed backplane which can handle dozens of 1 Gigabit communication sessions between devices simultaneously with Ubiquity UniFi AP, Dual-Band 802.11n access points installed strategically throughout the building.  These dual-band (2.4Ghz and 5Ghz) access points are centrally managed, monitored and tested to provide from 100Mbps to 450Mbps of connection speed. </p>
